        Output is a list with rankings of different objects.
         - also includes **Best_performance_object** 
        
        ## Installation
        `pip install topsis_nishant_76`
        
        *Recommended - test it out in a virtual environment.* 
        
        ## Upgrade
        `pip install topsis_nishant_76 --upgrade`
        
        ## To use via command line
        `topsis_cli mydata.csv '1,2,1,1' '-,+,+,+'`
        
        First argument is filename with .csv extension. The .csv file is assumed to have a structure similar to one provided in topsis_nishant_76/mydata.csv
        
        That is, the .csv file should have a header with column names and first column should only list alternatives and not attribute values.
        
        ## To use in .py script
        ```
        from topsis_nishant_76 import topsis_nish
        """
        decision_matrix is 2D numpy array, weights is a string seperated with ',' and impacts is a string of the form '+,-,+,-' 
        where + indicates benefit and - indicates cost
        """
        topsis_nish('mydata.csv','1,2,1,1','+,-,+,+')
        ```
